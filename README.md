# AI-assistance
🤖 AI Assistance Project
📌 Overview
The AI Assistance Project is a Java-based application designed to simulate an intelligent assistant that interacts with users, processes their queries, and provides automated responses.
This project focuses on applying core Java and OOP concepts to build a scalable and user-friendly AI assistant.

🎯 Objectives
• To understand the fundamentals of AI-based applications
• To implement rule-based intelligent responses
• To strengthen Java programming and OOP concepts
• To build a clean, modular, and    maintainable application

🛠️ Technologies Used
• Java
• OOP Concepts (Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)
• Collections Framework
• Exception Handling
• Rule-Based AI Logic
• Console / UI-based Interaction

✨ Features
• Intelligent response to user queries
• Automated suggestions and assistance
• Modular design using OOP principles
• Error handling for invalid user inputs
• Easy-to-use console-based

🚀 How to Run the Project
1• Clone the repository
https://github.com/Samruddha28/AI-assistance
2• Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
3• Compile and run the Sarav.java file
4• Start interacting with the AI assistant through the console

🧠 How It Works
• The user enters a query through the console
• The system processes input using rule-based AI logic
• A suitable response is generated and displayed
• Exceptions are handled to ensure smooth execution
